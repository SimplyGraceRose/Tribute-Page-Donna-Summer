        <i>Without Donna, there'd be no techno, no house. She was a huge influence on Electropop too. Whatever she may or may not have said about AIDS in the early eighties, much of her gay fanbase - me included - had long made their peace with her. I had the privilege to see her live once.</i> <br><br>
